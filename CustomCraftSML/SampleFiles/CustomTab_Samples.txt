# These are samples for adding your own custom crafting tab nodes to the game's existing fabricators. #
# After you add new tabs here, you can use them to better organize your AddedRecipes. #
# If you want to add your new tab inside an existing one, you will need internal name of that tab. #
# You can find all the internal names of all tabs to all fabricators in the README file. #

# The Custom Tabs update comes with some new additions to what you can do with EasyMarkup, so pay close attention to the samples here. #

CustomCraftingTabs: 
(
    TabID: Doodads;  # This will be the internal name for this new tab #
    DisplayName: "Doodas and Gizmos";  # This is the name displayed in-game for your tab. If you want this name to have spaces, you will need to wrap it in quotes as shown. #
    SpriteItemID: AdvancedWiringKit; # This is the ItemID for the in-game item that will be used as the sprite for your custom tab. #
    FabricatorType: Fabricator; # This is the fabricator that tab will go to. For a full list of available fabricators, check the README file. #
    ParentTabID: Personal; # This is the tab under which this will go. If you want to add your tab to the root of the crafting tree, just leave this out. #
